# Virtual Pet Shelter

Virtual pet shelter is an application that a shelter volunteer and customer can interact with to accomplish
several tasks like feeding, watering, playing, adopting and admitting. 

The user must watch the hunger, thirst and boredom levels of the animals so that it would not get out of control.

While the user can feed and water all the pets at once, they can only play with one animal at a time.
